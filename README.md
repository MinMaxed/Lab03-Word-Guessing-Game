# Lab03-Word-Guessing-Game

## Purpose
This application is designed to select a word a random from a bank of words, and play a type of hangman game where the user guesses letters until the word is revealed. The user will be able to CRUD the wordbank. 

## Visual
no visual of the app working as it does not work yet. Only currently have game menus. Will attach once able. 

## How to Use
UI is basic, you have a main menu with two paths, one to play the game where the user will enter letter by letter to find the randomly chosen word from the word bank. after the game, the user will go back to the main menu. 

The other path takes the user to the CRUD options, where they will be able to choose too add something new to the wordbank, delete something from the wordbank if it exists, view all the words currently in the bank, and return to the base game menu. 

## Notes
as stated above, the app does not work yet. I have a lot of the pieces, and I think I've got a clear image in my head of what it's supposed to look like, but still having trouble putting it all together.
